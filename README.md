# GBA repro patches

Collection of batteryless patches for chinese repro cartridges to save inside the rom

I want to restructure the whole repo as by now important information for the patches are missing. fe chip, board revision and so on.

For contributions please provide the following:

 - Picture of the Cartridge board
 - Information in txt about the chips
 - patchfile

It can be zipped and sent by PR.

How to use:

Get the base rom of the game and patch it with the patches in this repository.

You can use Rom Patcher JS
