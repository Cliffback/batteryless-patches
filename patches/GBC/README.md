Pokemon Gold de

Pokemon Silver de

```
How to check if your cartridge supports that patch:

Open up FlashGBX -> Detect Cartridge -> Details

Flash ID Check will provide you the needed information
```
[     ROM     ] F3 C3 00 01 00 00 00 00 
[WR   / AAA/A9] 02 02 7D 7D 00 00 08 08 
[WR   /4AAA/A9] 02 02 7D 7D 00 00 08 08 
[WR   /7AAA/A9] 02 02 7D 7D 00 00 08 08
```
Here you can see if the method is supported.

F.e 
Pokemon Gold en would work on the cartridge
Pokemon Gold de would not as the method is 555/A9
